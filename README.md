## Description

For the 4th (technically 3rd) homework for UW-bootcamp we were required to build a functional quiz using JavaScript.

This was built to develop my skills in building functions within JavaScript and to practice my skills at problem solving to build working code.

I learned how to target variables within the realm of scope, to create a timer that has functionality built within it and how to link all my pages together to build a working website.

## Usage

This quiz is developed to have a start button that deploys a timer and creates quiz questions that move from one to the next as they are answered.

The timer will continue as normal or lose time if a question is incorrect.

![wrong_answer](./assets/images/wrong_answer.png)

When the quiz is finished, the user can store their initials in local storage or try again.

After storing initials, the user can view their and any other scores stored in the system. They can also clear the highscores or return to the start of the quiz.
